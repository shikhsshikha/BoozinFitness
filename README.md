*BoozinFitness App*

1. About the Project
This was a task where I had to create a basic Flutter application from scratch.
The app has a splash screen with a short animation, and after that, it moves to the home screen where the main content is displayed.
It’s a simple project but made in a way that it can be easily extended with more features later.

2. What the App Does
- Shows a splash screen first
- Then navigates to the home screen
- UI is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Code is organized for easy updates in the future

3. Tech Stack Used
- Flutter
- Dart
- Android Studio for development
- Git for version control

4. How to Run
- Install Flutter on your system and set up the environment
  
- Clone this repository:
  git clone https://github.com/shikhsshikha/BoozinFitness.git

- Open the folder in Android Studio (or any preferred IDE)
  
- Run the following command to get all dependencies:
  flutter pub get

- Connect your emulator or device and run:
  flutter run

5. How It Works:
- Splash Screen: Shows a quick animation before the main screen
- Navigation: After splash, moves to the home screen using Flutter’s Navigator
- Home Screen: Displays the core UI for now (placeholder for future features)
